This is my personal portfolio, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project styled with [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)

###### Based in Argentina!

# Iván Gentta | Portfolio

This site will work as a presentation of my work and as kind of a journal of my journey as a Full-Stack developer !
While I keep learning, I keep improving this site with new features and cleaner code.

Technologies:

- NextJS
- Reactwich
- Tailwind CSS
- Yarn

## Full responsive / Components

You can view my projects in any device, I always start from the mobile view #mobileFirst.

- You can navigate my portfolio with its fixed _navbar_.
- Get to know me in the _main_ and _about_ components.
- In the _skills_ component see what technologies I know.
- See a demo and its code of my other projects in the _projects_ component.
- And in the _contact_ component you can get in touch with me with a form from [getForm.io](https://getform.io/)

## Translations

Now with Spanish and English translations !

It detects the language of your browser and set it and also you can choose from the navbar wich language you want.

## Prettier README.md

I just learn to log my projects with this beautiful README, what do you think?

Thanks for passing by ! **Iván Gentta**
